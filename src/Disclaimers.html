                                The limitations and disclaimer in this section do not purport to limit liability or alter your rights as a consumer that cannot be excluded under applicable law. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, 1SaleRX’s liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by law. This provision shall have no effect on 1SaleRX’s choice of law provision set forth below. To the extent any aspects of the foregoing limitations of liability are not enforceable, the maximum liability of 1SaleRX to you with respect to your use of the services is $50 (fifty dollars). You hereby agree to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all laws that limit the efficacy of such indemnifications or releases.</p>
